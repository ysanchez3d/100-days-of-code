### Day 1: February 1, 2024

**Today's Progress**: Started [Boot.Dev](https://boot.dev) back-end development program. I finished chapters 1-4 of the "Learn Python" course. I covered some basic concepts: `variables`, `strings`, `functions declarations`, and 'scope'.

**Key Python Notes**

- Python uses **snake_case** convetion
- **Spaces** MUST be correct for functions, loops, statement, etc... to work properly
- Functions that don't have a `return` keyword automatically return the `None` data type
- Floored Division operator "//" >>> `7 // 3 == 2`
- Valid operators like in JS `+=, -=, *=, /=`
- Exponent operator "**" >>> `3**2 == 9`

**Thoughts:** So far I'm very happy with the course, it is very intuitive and every lesson has hands-on coding. Looking forward to be done with the basic chapters.
