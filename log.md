### Day 1: January 31, 2024

**Today's Progress**: Started [Boot.Dev](https://boot.dev) back-end development program. I finished chapters 1-4 of the "Learn Python" course. I covered some basic concepts: `variables`, `strings`, `functions declarations`, and 'scope'.

**Key Python Notes**

- Python uses **snake_case** convetion
- **Spaces** MUST be correct for functions, loops, statement, etc... to work properly
- Functions that don't have a `return` keyword automatically return the `None` data type
- Floored Division operator "//" >>> `7 // 3 == 2`
- Valid operators like in JS `+=, -=, *=, /=`
- Exponent operator "**" >>> `3**2 == 9`

**Thoughts:** So far I'm very happy with the course, it is very intuitive and every lesson has hands-on coding. Looking forward to be done with the basic chapters.

### Day 2: February 1, 2024

**Today's Progress**: Continued [Boot.Dev](https://boot.dev) course. Completed chapters 5-9 of the "Learn Python" course. Covered `Scientific Notation`, `Binary numbers`, `Logical Operators`, `Bitwise Operator`, `Comparison Operators`, `Conditional Logic`, `For Loop`, `Lists`, and `Tuples`. Also set up [This repo](https://github.com/ysanchez3d/DataStructures-and-Algorithms-Daily) to practice Test Driven Development(TDD), Algorithms, and Data Structures. Lastly I revisited `Mocha`, `Chai`, and how to properly write this `Markdown` syntax`.

**Key Python Notes**

- Scientific Notation: `print(16e3) #16000.0`, `print(7.1e-2) #0.071`
- Use underscores for readability: `num = 16_000`, `other_num = 71_234_000_000_000`
- Normal school math is a "Base 10" system. Binary uses a "Base 2" system
- Python uses `and` and 'or' instead of `& and ||` for expression evaluation
- Comparison operators: `<, >, <=, >=, ==, !=`
- Conditional Logic: `if:, elif:, else:`
- For Loop: `for i in range(0, 10):` . The range function takes an optional third parameter specifying negative or positive increments.
- Arrays are called "Lists". Use `len(list)` to get the length.
- No index loop syntax: `for tree in trees:`. Use when index is irrelevant.
- Negative Infinity: `Float('-inf')`. Positive Infinity: `Float('inf')`
- Slicing List Syntax: `my_list[start:stop:step]`. stop is exclusive.
- List Contains an item? `item in items_list` >> return True or False
- List Delete items: `del list_items[3] #deletes 4th item`, `del list_items[1:3] #deletes from index 1 to 3(exclusive)`, `del list_items[:] #deletes all items`
- Tuples: Fixed collection size. Usually used to store small groups of related data.
  - Example: `person_touple = ("Yandri", "Sanchez", 30)`

**Thoughts:** Very long day. I was only able to cover so much because of my familiarity with JavaScript. Really enjoying Python so far. Also had a refresher on `Mocha` and `Chai` in order to be able to setup the repo mentioned above.

### Day 3: February 2, 2024

**Today's Progress**: Practiced TDD by writing specs and then writing the methods. Today I implemented `push()`, `pop()`, `unshift()`, `shift()` on a custom Dynamic Array data structure. Then I practice CSS by doing todays challenge on (https://icodethis.com). Links to todays work below.
